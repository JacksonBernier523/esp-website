Nethermind is a .NET Core-based Ethereum client built by the team of the same name. Fast, lightweight and data analytics oriented, [Nethermind](https://nethermind.io) was created with enterprise in mind. The .NET framework is more common among enterprise applications than Rust or Go (the languages used for Parity and Geth respectively), making it a natural choice for a client aimed at enterprise users.

Nethermind founder Tomasz Stanczak worked in finance, foreign exchange and trading technology before falling for Ethereum. With Nethermind, he brought that experience to bear and set out to create a UI-focused client with all the features a finance business would need in order to access Ethereum's full potential.

Recently, the Nethermind team has made efforts to work with companies that use Ethereum integrations, focusing on delivering improvements needed for enterprise users. Some recent and upcoming additions to the Nethermind client include:

- Ethash: Proof of Work algorithm
- Aura: Consensus algorithm used in the Parity client
- Clique: Proof of Authority algorithm
- [Beam Sync](https://medium.com/@jason.carver/intro-to-beam-sync-a0fd168be14a) for even quicker initial sync time (in progress, targeted for Q1 2020)

The Nethermind team remains dedicated to maintaining and advancing Ethereum 1.0, with lots more improvements in the pipeline!
